# Lead_Score_CaseStudy

## Problem Statement

X Education, an education company, sells online courses to industry professionals. Each day, many interested professionals visit their website to explore courses. When these individuals fill out a form on the website, they are classified as leads. The sales team then follows up with these leads through phone calls and emails. However, only about 30% of the leads typically convert into customers, meaning that if 100 leads are acquired in a day, only about 30 will convert.

To improve this process, X Education aims to identify the most promising leads, known as Hot Leads. By focusing the sales team's efforts on these high-potential leads, the company expects to increase the lead conversion rate, making the process more efficient by reducing the need to reach out to less likely prospects.


## Business Objective

X Education wants to develop a model that assigns a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead, enabling them to identify Hot Leads and boost their conversion rate. The CEO's goal is to achieve a lead conversion rate of 80%. Additionally, the model should be adaptable to future challenges, such as managing peak-time actions, optimizing the use of manpower, and determining the appropriate strategies after reaching target goals.
